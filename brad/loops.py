# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

people = ['John', 'Paul', 'Sara', 'Susan']

#simple for loop
# for person in people:
#     print(f'Current Person {person}')

# #Break from a loop
# for person in people:
#     if person == 'Sara':
#         break
#     print(f'Current Person {person}')
    
# #Continue loop
# for person in people:
#     if person == 'Sara':
#         continue
#     print(f'Current Person {person}')

# for i in range(len(people)):
#     print(people[i])

# for i in range(1, 10):
#     print(f'Number : {i}')

# While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

# count = 0
# while count<= 10:
#     print(f'Count: {count}')
#     count +=1

#for loop
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
